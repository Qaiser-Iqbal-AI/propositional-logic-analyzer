# propositional-logic-analyzer
A comprehensive C++ program for propositional logic analysis, including truth table generation, argument validation, equivalence checking, and automated reasoning using rules of inference.

# Propositional Logic Analyzer in C++

This project is a comprehensive C++ implementation of a propositional logic analysis system.
It allows users to evaluate logical expressions, generate truth tables, validate arguments,
check logical equivalence, and derive conclusions using formal rules of inference.

The program was developed from scratch without using built-in string manipulation or logic libraries,
focusing on core computer science principles, algorithmic thinking, and correctness.

## Key Features

- Truth table generation for propositional logic expressions
- Validation of logical arguments using semantic entailment
- Logical equivalence checking between expressions
- Automated reasoning using rules of inference:
  - Modus Ponens
  - Modus Tollens
  - Hypothetical Syllogism
  - Disjunctive Syllogism
  - Simplification
- Support for logical operators:
  - NOT (!)
  - AND (&)
  - OR (|)
  - IMPLIES (>)
  - BICONDITIONAL (=)
- Custom-built expression parser and infix-to-postfix conversion (Shunting Yard Algorithm)
- File-based persistence for saved truth tables, arguments, and equivalence results
- Interactive console-based user interface

---

## Technologies Used

- C++
- Standard Template Library (STL) (minimal usage)
- Windows Console API for UI formatting

---

## Program Structure

The system is modular and function-driven, including:
- Custom input validation and tokenization
- Infix to postfix conversion
- Postfix expression evaluation
- Dynamic truth table generation
- Logical inference engine
- File handling for persistent result storage

No external logic or parsing libraries were used.

---

## How to Run

1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler (Windows recommended)
2. Run the executable
3. 
---

## Educational Purpose

This project was developed to strengthen understanding of:
- Propositional logic
- Formal reasoning
- Algorithm design
- Stack-based expression evaluation
- Clean and structured C++ programming

All logic and algorithms were implemented manually for learning purposes.

---

## Notes

- The program is designed for academic and educational use.
- Input expressions support up to 5 distinct variables.
- Console-based UI works best on Windows systems.
